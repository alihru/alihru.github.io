  Hello, my name is Alissia. 

  * I am originally from Estonia, where I have spent the first 12 years of my life. 🏡
  * Afterwards, my family and I moved to Ireland. I went to school in the beatuiful coastal town of Sligo. ☘️ 
  * After my secondary school graduation I decided that I want to study mathematics at NUI Galway. 🧮👩‍🎓
  * After graduating with a bachelor's degree in Mathematical Science, I moved to Vienna (Austria) to pursue a master's degree in 
    Quantitative Finance. I was excited to apply the many mathematical and computational concepts that I have learned over the years
    to the fascinating world of finance. 📈🐂
  * After attaining a master's degree in quant finance, I wanted to learn a little bit more about data science, machine learning and 
    advanced statistical methods. I also saw how applicable and relevant these methods were becoming within the realm of quant finance. 
    This motivated me to pursue a 1-year master's degree in Data and Computational Science at University College Dublin. I am currently 
    enrolled in this programme and I am looking for employment opportunities. 👩‍💻
    
  Feel free to reach out and have a good day! 👋😊

          This is the thesis that I wrote as part of the master's degree in Quantitative Finance.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This master's thesis examines firm-level contemporaneous and lagged relationships between
          Tweet-based features (i.e., Twitter activity and sentiment polarity) and stock market 
          characteristics (i.e., holding period return and trading volume) at daily frequency. 
          Our findings support the existence of contemporaneous association between Twitter mood 
          and returns (turnover), together with the relation of Tweet volume and returns (turnover). 
          Furthermore, we established that investor agreement and Tweet volume could be of use in predicting abnormal 
          trading volume on the following day. In contrast to previous closely related research, we found no indication of 
          Twitter-based investor sentiment and interest being helpful in predicting returns, which was subsequently reflected 
          in the underwhelming performance of the corresponding long-short portfolios. Nevertheless, we observed that aggregation 
          of firm-level Twitter sentiment can be beneficial in forecasting the performance of ETFs, stock indices and portfolios.

          This project focused on automated extraction of valuable information from annual financial reports. I 
          completed this project in the course of my Quantitative Finance degree with Raiffeisen Research. 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          In recent years the European Single Electronic Standard (ESEF) has been introduced by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). 
          It mandates that annual financial reports of issuers within scope must be prepared in XHTML format with XBRL tags, embedded using Inline XBRL technology and 
          based on the ESEF taxonomy. We developed an R package in order to automate the process of financial data retrieval and reduce reliance 
          on manual data extraction and external sources, such as Bloomberg and Refinitiv. Furthermore, we tested some simple trading strategies 
          based on extracted financial ratios and conducted ESG sentiment analysis on retrieved textual data.

          You can download the vignette for the corresponding R package [here](assets/rESEF_vignette.html).
