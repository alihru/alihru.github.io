  Hello, my name is Alissia. I am originally from Estonia, where I have spent the first 12 years of my life. 
  Afterwards my family and I moved to Ireland. I went to school in the beatuiful coastal town of Sligo. 
  Afterwards I decided that I want to study mathematics at NUI Galway. After graduating with a bachelor's in Mathematical Sciences
  I moved to Vienna (Austria) to pursue a master's degree in quantitative finance. I was excited to apply the many mathematical and 
  computational concepts that I have learned over the years to the fascinating world of finance. After attaining a master's degree 
  in quant finance, I wanted to learn a little bit more about data science, machine learning and advanced statistical methods. I 
  also saw how applicable and relevant these methods are becoming for the realm of quant finance. This motivated me to pursue a 
  1-year master's degree in Data and Computational Science at the University College Dublin. I am currently enrolled in this programme and
  I am looking for employment opportunities. Feel free to reach out! Have a good day :)

          This is the thesis that I wrote as part of the master's degree in quantitative finance.

          This master's thesis examines firm-level contemporaneous and lagged relationships between
          Tweet-based features (i.e., Twitter activity and sentiment polarity) and stock market 
          characteristics (i.e., holding period return and trading volume) at daily frequency. 
          Our findings support the existence of contemporaneous association between Twitter mood 
          and returns (turnover), together with the relation of Tweet volume and returns (turnover). 
          Furthermore, we established that investor agreement and Tweet volume could be of use in predicting abnormal 
          trading volume on the following day. In contrast to previous closely related research, we found no indication of 
          Twitter-based investor sentiment and interest being helpful in predicting returns, which was subsequently reflected 
          in the underwhelming performance of the corresponding long-short portfolios. Nevertheless, we observed that aggregation 
          of firm-level Twitter sentiment can be beneficial in forecasting the performance of ETFs, stock indices and portfolios.
